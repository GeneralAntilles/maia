Although the MAIA survey is copyrighted, it is available without charge and no
written permission is required for its use. This assumes agreement with the
following as a consequence of using a MAIA survey:
* Please refer to the survey using its complete name â€“ Multidimensional
Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness - and provide the appropriate citation.
* Modifications may be made without our written permission. However, please
clearly identify any modifications in any publications as having been made by
the users. If you modify the survey, please let us know for our records.
* We recommend including entire subscales when selecting items from the MAIA
to retain the psychometric features of these subscales (rather than selecting
items from subscales).
* If you translate the MAIA into another language, please send us a copy for
our records. *If other investigators are interested in obtaining the survey,
please refer them to the source document (PLoS- ONE 2012, and
www.osher.ucsf.edu/maia/) to assure they obtain the most recent version and
