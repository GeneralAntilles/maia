# Web-based MAIA questionnaire

The [Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awaraness questionnaire](https://osher.ucsf.edu/research/maia) is a multidimensional self-report measure of interoceptive body awareness, the individual's awareness of and ability to sense internal bodily signals. This is a web-based version of the questionnaire built with Django.

The [official questionnaire](https://osher.ucsf.edu/sites/osher.ucsf.edu/files/inline-files/MAIA2%202018.05.27.pdf) is a PDF document that requires manual scoring and I built this to make it easier to take and score the questionnaire.

## MAIA Version 2

MAIA Version 2 is a 37-item quistionnaire that assesses various dimensions of interoceptive awareness using a six-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (never) to 5 (always). The questionnaire is divided into eight subcales, each addressing a specific aspect of interoceptive awareness:

1. **Noticing**: The ability to sense and recognize bodily sensations.
2. **Not-Distracting**: The tendency to divert attention away from uncomfortable bodily sensations.
3. **Not-Worrying**: The inclination to experience emotional distress in response to bodily sensations.
4. **Attention Regulation**: The ability to sustain and control attention to bodily sensations.
5. **Emotional Awareness**: The ability to link bodily sensations with emotional states.
6. **Self-Regulation**: The capacity to regulate psychological and emotional responses based on bodily sensations.
7. **Body Listening**: The propensity to actively listen and respond to the body's needs.
8. **Trusting**: The confidence in one's ability to interpret and respond to bodily signals appropriately.

MAIA has been employed in various research contexts, such as studying the relationship between interoceptive awareness and mental health, investigating the role of interoception in mindfulness practices, and understanding how interoceptive awareness may contribute to the development and treatment of different psychological disorders.
